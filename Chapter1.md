# Chapter 1: The Linux Foundation

### INTRODUCTION
___


This course will teach:
  * the fundamentals of what Linux is
  * Teach you how to use the command line

We will talk about some of the basics of the Linux foundation. This intro will also talk through some of the basics of how this course will work. We will also pick out a Linux distribution that is right for you.

### SECTION 1: THE LINUX FOUNDATION
___


Linux started in 1991 and powers everything from the New York Stock Exchange to phones to supercomputers. The Linux foundation was founded in 2000 and serves to promote protect and advance Linux. The Linux foundation is supported by leading technology companies and thousands of individuals. The Linux foundation:
  * Produces technical events throughout the world
  * Develops and delivers training programs
  * Host collaborative projects
  * Manages kernel.org where the official Linux kernel is released
  * Runs Linux.com

The Linux foundation hosts conferences throughout the world that:
  * provides an open forum for developing the next kernel release
  * brings together developers and sysadmins to solve problems
  * Hosts workgroups and community groups
  * Connects end users, sysadmins, and kernel developers
  * Encourages collaboration among the community

Linux Events are places where the industry and the Linux community meet.

### SECTION 2: LINUX FOUNDATION TRAINING
___


Linux, despite how it is portrayed, doesn't have to be intimidating. We can collaborate to jumpstart our training. Linux Foundation classes help build skills that individuals and organizations need. With these skills, we can continue on with self-directed learning. The Linux foundation training is designed by members of the community. The sysadmin course focuses on enterprise Linux environments. They target:
  * System administrators
  * technical support
  * architects

The developer course features instructors and content from the leaders of the Linux community The Linux foundation training is:
  * distribution-flexible
  * technically advanced
  * created with actual leaders of the Linux development community

Most courses are more than 50% hands-on. The Linux Foundation training options. There are a ton of Linux jobs available on the market today and not enough people to fill that demand. The Linux foundation seeks to make a strong pool of talent to meet that need. Because of the scattered nature of a lot of things in Linux, it is difficult for people to assemble material on their own. The Linux foundation is vendor neutral. Everything is extremely up to date.

The foundation has a strong connection with a lot of leading kernel developers so it is easy to contribute to development. Students will get detailed course manuals that are essentially books. They are easy to reference later on in a few years. After the course, it is easy to find jobs in the industry. Can integrate into the professional community and the development community. The Linux foundation has the copyright for all of these course materials.

### SECTION 3: COURSE LINUX REQUIREMENTS
___


In order to fully benefit from this course, you should have at least one Linux distro installed. In this section, we will learn about some of the available distros. The families and representative distributions are:
  * Debian family systems (Ubuntu)
  * SUSE family systems (openSUSE)
  * Fedora family systems (CentOS)

There are three main Linux distributions, all of them are based around the Linux kernel
  + the Debian family
    * Ubuntu
    * Linux mint
  + the Fedora family
    * RHEL
     + CentOS
     + OracleLinux
  + the SUSE family
    * SLES
    * openSUSE
  + other distros

Fedora is the community distro that forms the basis of RHEL, CentOS, Scientific Linux, and Oracle Linux. Fedora contains much more software than RHEL. One reason is that there is a diverse community building fedora. centos is used in this demo mainly because it has a longer dev cycle than fedora. The Linux kernel in RHEL/CentOS 6.x is 2.6.32. It supports x86, x86-64, itanium, powerpc, and ibm system z. fedora uses the RPM-based yum package manager. RHEL is widely used by enterprise which host their own systems.












SUSE, SUSE Linux Enterprise Server (SLES), and openSUSE are similar to the relationship between the fedora-based distros. openSUSE 12.3 is used as an example as this one. Most things in openSUSE can be applied to SLES and SUSE with no problem. SLES is upstream for openSUSE. openSUSE 12.3 uses Linux kernel 3.11. SUSE uses the RPM-based zypper package manager. it includes YaST (Yet another System Tool) application for sysadmin purposes. SUSE is widely used in the retail sector.

The debian distro is upstream for several distributions such as ubuntu, which is upstream for Linux mint. It is commonly used on servers and desktop computers. Debian is a pure open source project and focuses on stability. It also provides the largest and most complete software repository to its users. Ubuntu aims at providing a compromise between stability and ease of use. Ubuntu gets most of its packages from Debian, so it also has a large software repository. Ubuntu 14.04 LTS (long term support) is used in this course. Ubuntu 14.04 uses Linux kernel 3.13. Debian-based systems use the DPKG-based apt-get package manager. Ubuntu has been widely used for cloud deployments. Ubuntu now uses the unity graphical interface and is GNOME-based.

The material provided by the Linux foundation is distribution-flexible. Technical explanations, labs, and procedures should be applicable to most modern distros. When choosing a Linux distro, you will notice that most technical differences are mainly:
  * package-management systems
  * software versions
  * file locations The desktop environment used for this course is GNOME. There are several different environments, but GNOME is the most popular.

## SUMMARY
___

  * The Linux foundation is a nonprofit consortium dedicated to fostering the growth of Linux.
  * the Linux foundation training is for the community by the community.
  * It is distribution-flexible, technically advanced, and created with the leaders of the Linux community.
  * The three main distro families are fedora, SUSE, and Debian.
