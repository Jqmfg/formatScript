Fix Tables on md files (refer to pandoc.org/README.html#tables for more info)
Fix h1 (#) formatting (doesn't have a newline placed on it)
Might have to do tables with the same format as code blocks
Will probably have to do a straight replacement for the h1 blocks because of the way they are inserted
Look to make sure that the other header blocks worked right
Go over the list of possible github-flavored markdown that can be used to see if I might have missed anything
Browse through the complete documents (both .md and .pdf) to see if there are any blatantly wrong formatting errors
